# 📈 Gold Price Prediction using LSTM + Streamlit

This project predicts future gold prices using a deep learning model (LSTM) trained on historical data from **2013 to 2023**. The model is deployed via an interactive **Streamlit web app** that provides real-time next-day price predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- 📅 Historical gold price data (2013–2023)
- 🔁 Preprocessing with MinMaxScaler
- 🧠 LSTM model trained using TensorFlow/Keras
- 📊 Real-time predictions via Streamlit
- 📈 Visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib
- 🔮 Predicts the next day’s gold price using a sliding window of the last 60 days
